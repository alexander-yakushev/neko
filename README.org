  Neko is a toolkit designed to make Android development using Clojure easier
  and more fun. It provides different facilities that wrap Android's Java API
  and are more idiomatic to use from Clojure. Neko does not try to wrap every
  API class or method, as they are always accessible to a developer through
  interop. Instead Neko only offers substitutes to Java API where it really
  simplifies the development and gives better understanding of the code.

  Neko is developed under [[http://clojure-android.info/][Clojure-Android initiative]].

** Installation

   Add the following line to the dependencies of your Clojure/Android project:

   [[https://clojars.org/neko][https://clojars.org/neko/latest-version.svg]]

   If you use [[https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid][lein-droid]] to create and build your project (which you
   should), the Neko dependency will already be there.

** Documentation

   For your first dive into Clojure on Android development, see this
   [[https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid/wiki/Tutorial][Tutorial]].

   For detailed information on available features and utilities,
   please consult the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko/wiki][wiki]].

   Marginalia docs are available [[http://clojure-android.github.io/neko/][here]].

** Building Neko

   If you want to modify/extend Neko source code and then use it in
   your applications, you can build it yourself. Use =lein droid jar=
   in neko's directory to create a JAR file which then can be pushed
   to Clojars under your name or installed into a local Maven repo.

   Make sure that =:target-version= defined in =project.clj= matches
   the Android SDK version you have installed.

   If you have problems building Neko, try running =lein clean= first.
   Also you can use =DEBUG=1 lein droid jar= for additional build
   information.

** Acknowledgments

   Neko was originally written by [[https://github.com/sattvik][Daniel Solano Gómez]]. This version is a fork by
   Alexander Yakushev as part of Google Summer of Code 2012/2013 participation
   project.

   I thank Remco van 't Veer for his [[https://github.com/remvee/clj-android][clj-android]] library which was one of the
   pioneer attempts to bring Clojure to Android development. Some features in my
   Neko fork are inspired by ideas from his project.

   I also thank all the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko/graphs/contributors][contributors]] to Neko.
