(ns neko.compilation
  "Utility functions for managing the compilation environment when using
  version of Clojure that supports dynamic compilation on the Dalvik virtual
  machine.

  To use this namespace, you need to call init with a context, such as an
  activity object.  This will create a cache directory where temporary files
  will be placed and will set the 'clojure.compile.path' system property and
  the '*compile-path*' var.  If the cache directory already exists, it will be
  cleaned out.

  Note that additional invocations to init within the same process will not have
  any effect."
