  "Utility for logging in Android.  To use this utility simply use the deflog
  macro as follows:

    (deflog \"MyTag\")

  This will intern a number of functions in your namespace, namely: log-d,
  log-v, log-i, log-w, log-e, and log-wtf.  These functions will perform the
  equivalent of calling the corresponding method on the android.util.Log
  class with the tag given in the deflog macro call.

  For example, given the above deflog call,

    (log-d \"Some log string\")

  is equivalent to:

    (android.util.Log/d \"MyTag\" \"Some log string\")

  Calls to log-wtf on platforms that do not support Log.wtf() will be
  downgraded to Log.e() calls."
